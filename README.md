# Chatroom-Project
Chatroom application allowing multiple users to chat with one another with security and privacy in mind.

# Notes 

Idea One:
Socket Programming to create a server - client(s) chat room. 
Low latency communication on LAN
Encryption and decryption of user sent data

1) Networking and Security 

2) Most research for this chatroom project will be derived from python forums and research papers which discuss socket programming and encryption. Other sources for research will be open source github projects with similar abstract.

3) Through research and practice, we hope to implement a multi user chatroom application. In essence we will be building a server side program and a client side program which seamlessly communicates with each other, even when multiple clients exist. Another important aspect we will be implementing, is the encryption of the entire server or perhaps the data sent by the clients. This will ensure the multi user chatroom is safe and secure. After all, we can add more features for better user experiences.
